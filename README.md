# School Crossing Guards

This a story map on school crossing guards in upper Manhattan, that combines crash data. This will hopefully show that there are significant need to fill vacant posts.

Building using React + Tailwindcss + MapboxGL + [React Scrollama](https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama)

## Todos 
- Read [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) to remove all .csv, .ipynb, .geojson/.geo.json history from this repo. Alternatively delete .git and reupload the repo.
- Create a better narrative with pictures and other research
- Improvements to styling of the crash points (zoom based sizing?)
- Pending data for the rest of Manhattan
